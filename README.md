# Task 2.15 Labyrinth of Kitties game

### The basics of the game:
    We have a labyrinth with a finish point, and a ball (a kitty), which we want to roll to the finish point.
    The ball can only move in 4 directions, and won't stop rolling until it runs into a wall.

### How to win the game:
    Move the ball into the finish point, using the buttons (or arrow keys).

### Ideas for future development/extending the game:
* May want to include a limit to steps, just to spice things up
* Since I made a nice cat shaped GUI with a soft gradient, may extend the code to give the user the ability of changing the colors of the GUI (I just want more cats, honestly)
